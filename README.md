#### 2. Running the program.
- Open the downloaded ZIP file (your IG data)
- From the **followers_and_following** folder, extract **followers.html** and **following.html** to your preferred location.:heavy_exclamation_mark:If you are on macOS, you must extract it to your Downloads folder:heavy_exclamation_mark:(Once you got the required files extracted, you can erase the ZIP file.)
- **(IMPORTANT)** If your followers.html or following.html files names are different like "following_1.html" or "followers_1.html" simply just erase any underscores or numbers from the file name.

Mac users please follow the steps from [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/ZctITIb)

For Windows, just run smh.exe 

#### 3. Pay them back, shake your head.
- Click on the username to get redirected to their Instagram page to unfollow (or whatever you would like to do with) them.  :smiling_imp: :smiling_imp:
- You can also transfer the **smh.html** file to your mobile phone for ease of access.

:warning: Please do note that Instagram will lock your account if you unfollow too many people at once.
<p> Instagram starts to stop me after unfollowing 20-30+ accounts continuously. It is recommended not to unfollow more than 100 accounts a day. </p>
  
### Uninstall:

- Just delete the smh.exe/smh.dmg file and html files if you don't require them anymore
